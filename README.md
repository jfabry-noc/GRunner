# Background

Python project to familiarize myself with basic game design. The game is written in Python using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). The idea is to work on it for a month as part of the [GitHub Game Off](https://github.blog/2020-10-27-github-game-off-2020/) since I've never done anything game development-related before.

# Premise

The idea behind the game is that my good friend and former colleague Garrett has reformed to become the best version of himself, Garrett Primeâ„¢. Garrett Prime is trying to shed his previous love for Dell laptops running Windows and inferior editors like VSCode in favor of Apple laptops and Vim.

Touching an Apple or Vim icon will grant 5 points. Touching a Dell or VSCode icon will end the game. The speed of the game increases as time goes on.

The high score for the current session is tracked until the game is closed.
