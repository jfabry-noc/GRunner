# Background

Python project to familiarize myself with basic game design. The game is written in Python using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). The idea is to work on it for a month as part of the [GitHub Game Off](https://github.blog/2020-10-27-github-game-off-2020/). This will be filled out more as development continues.
